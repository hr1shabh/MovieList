# MovieList
I tried implementing all the features possible.
This site can take data from api and display it properly. It is mobile responsive too. By default it will take data according to search = 'dark' (like dark knight etc)
Search function is completely working. 
When we click on any movie, we will get the details of it (previous comments) in a visually appealing way.
The only problem I am facing is: If we have commented on any movie and we try to comment on another movie: it will first show alert and then accumulate the previous comments 
with the new one and store it in current movie comments. I could have solved this problem, but time was the contraint. Please look into other parts of the Project for evalution.
